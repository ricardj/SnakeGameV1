SNAKE GAME
In this game, you control a snake, made of hexagons, with your mouse.
The snake will follow the position of your mouse, and if you stop
moving your mouse, the snake will keep moving forward.
If the snake goes off-screen, it will appear on the other side of the
screen.
You have to eat as many worms as possible in 60 seconds. Each worm
you eat, will increase by one hexagon the lenght of your snake.
After the time has passed, it will be showed on screen how many
worms you have eaten. Then, you can press any key to restart and
play a new game.
